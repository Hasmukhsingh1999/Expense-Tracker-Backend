# What is QraphQL Schema?

- A GraphQL schema is a fundamental concept in GraphQL.
- It defines the structure of the data that clients can query and the operations they can perform. A schema in GraphQL typically consists of two main parts: typeDefs and resolvers.

# What are TypeDefs? (or Type Definitions)

- Type definitions define the shape of the data available in the GraphQL API. They specify the types of objects that can be queried and the relationships between them.

# What are Resolvers?

- Resolvers are functions that determine how to fetch the data associated with each field in the schema.

# Apollo Client

- Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your UI.
